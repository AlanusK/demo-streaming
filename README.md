# ELLIPSIS_JS_CHALLENGE

A web app that shows popular series and movies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### architecture

This project follows the architecture design of enclosing each component and page in its own folder with everything needed such as styles and tests

### notes

- The deployable solution will be contained inside `build` folder instead of `dist` folder. This is due to the fact that this project is scaffolded by CREACT-REACT-APP, should I have got more time, I should have put it in the `dist` folder.

- Only `Header` component has been tested, If get more time I will add more tests for each component.

- If I were allocated more time I will improve responsiveness of the app especially the `Header` component, add the logic to display the first 21 data entries, fix all warning error appearing at the console, refactor some codes into components and add more tests for each component.

- You will find all of my work in the `develop` branch
