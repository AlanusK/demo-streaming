The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### architecture

This project follows the architecture design of enclosing each component and page in its own folder with everything needed such as styles and tests

### notes

- The deployable solution will be contained inside `build` folder instead of `dist` folder. This is caused by the fact that this project
is scaffolded by CREACT-REACT-APP, should I have got more time, I should have put it in the `dist` folder.

- Only `Header` component has been tested, If get more time I will add more tests for each component.
